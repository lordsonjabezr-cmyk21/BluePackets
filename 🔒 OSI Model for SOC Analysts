The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a foundational networking concept, but for SOC Analysts it becomes a practical framework to map attacks, logs, and detection methods across different layers.

This write-up consolidates the core functions, SOC relevance, common attacks, tools, and methodologies for each OSI layer.

Layer 1 ‚Äì Physical Layer

Core Functions: Transmission of raw bits over physical medium (cables, NICs, signals).
SOC Role:

Detect hardware tampering, rogue device connections.

Correlate outages with physical security events (power loss, unauthorized access).
Attacks: Wiretapping, jamming, rogue USB drops.
Tools: NAC (Cisco ISE, Aruba ClearPass), CCTV integrations, SIEM, forensic USB tools.
Methodology: Baseline device inventory, detect rogue devices, isolate ports, escalate infra issues.

Layer 2 ‚Äì Data Link Layer

Core Functions: Node-to-node communication using MAC addresses, ARP, VLANs.
SOC Role:

Monitor ARP spoofing, VLAN hopping, rogue access points.

Detect MAC flooding, duplicate IP/MAC conflicts.
Attacks: ARP poisoning, MAC spoofing, VLAN hopping.
Tools: Wireshark, Snort/Suricata, Nmap (ARP scans), NAC solutions.
Methodology: Baseline VLAN/MAC activity, detect abnormal ARP traffic, quarantine rogue devices.

Layer 3 ‚Äì Network Layer

Core Functions: Logical addressing (IP), routing, packet forwarding.
SOC Role:

IP-based threat detection, firewall log analysis.

Spot DDoS, IP spoofing, tunneling attempts.
Attacks: DoS/DDoS, scanning, IP spoofing, ICMP tunneling.
Tools: SIEM (Splunk, QRadar), NetFlow, Zeek, Threat Intel (VirusTotal, MISP).
Methodology: Correlate SIEM alerts with TI feeds, block malicious IPs, detect abnormal routing.

Layer 4 ‚Äì Transport Layer

Core Functions: End-to-end communication, segmentation, TCP/UDP, ports.
SOC Role:

Monitor port scanning, brute-force, SYN floods.

Detect abnormal service/port activity.
Attacks: Port scanning, SYN floods, UDP amplification, session hijacking.
Tools: IDS/IPS (Snort, Suricata), Nmap, DDoS protection (Arbor, Cloudflare), Wireshark.
Methodology: Baseline normal ports, detect unusual connections, block malicious traffic.

Layer 5 ‚Äì Session Layer

Core Functions: Establishes, manages, and terminates sessions (RDP, SMB, VPN).
SOC Role:

Monitor VPN, RDP, SMB, Kerberos sessions.

Detect brute force, session hijacking, persistence.
Attacks: Credential stuffing, brute force, Pass-the-Ticket, session hijacking.
Tools: SIEM, EDR/XDR (CrowdStrike, SentinelOne), VPN logs, Zeek.
Methodology: Monitor login anomalies (impossible travel, concurrent sessions), terminate suspicious sessions, reset creds.

Layer 6 ‚Äì Presentation Layer

Core Functions: Data formatting, encryption/decryption, encoding/decoding, compression.
SOC Role:

Monitor SSL/TLS usage, detect malicious payload encoding.

Spot obfuscation and tunneling.
Attacks: SSL stripping, TLS abuse, Base64 obfuscation, DNS tunneling.
Tools: DPI (Palo Alto, Fortinet), IDS (Suricata, Zeek), Malware Sandboxing (Cuckoo, Any.Run).
Methodology: Detect weak/abnormal encryption, decode suspicious payloads, block unauthorized encrypted channels.

üåê Layer 7 ‚Äì Application Layer

Core Functions: End-user services (HTTP, DNS, SMTP, FTP, LDAP).
SOC Role:

Monitor web, DNS, and email logs.

Detect phishing, web exploits, DNS tunneling, data exfiltration.
Attacks: SQL injection, XSS, phishing, DNS tunneling, malware via email.
Tools: WAF (Cloudflare, ModSecurity), Email Gateways (Proofpoint, Mimecast), DNS Security (Umbrella, Infoblox), SIEM.
Methodology: Baseline app usage, correlate web/DNS/email logs, sandbox suspicious files, block malicious domains/URLs.

Key Takeaways for SOC Analysts

Most critical layers: 3 (Network), 4 (Transport), and 7 (Application).

Baseline + Detection + Correlation + Response is the methodology across all layers.

Tools like SIEM, IDS/IPS, NAC, WAF, EDR, DNS/email security map directly to OSI layers.

Understanding the OSI model helps triage faster, hunt smarter, and explain incidents clearly in interviews or real SOC operations.
